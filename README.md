# React Web App with Redux Toolkit and React Router

#### Welcome to Fast React Pizza! This is a web application built using React, Redux Toolkit, and React Router.


# Overview
#### Fast React Pizza is an online pizza ordering platform that I built as a project to enhance my skills in React development. While the app is not currently operational, it serves as a demonstration of my learning journey with React, Redux Toolkit, and React Router. Through building this project, I've gained valuable experience in creating dynamic user interfaces, managing state effectively, and implementing seamless navigation. Although the app is not functional at the moment, it showcases my dedication to continuous learning and improvement in React development.
